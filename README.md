# QAComponents-analysis
This is the Github repository for the submitted JWS paper "No One is Perfect: Analysing the Performance of Question Answering Components over the DBpedia Knowledge Graph".
Following are the folders in the repository for various experiments in the paper: The original Frankenstein repository: [Frankenstein Framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Frankenstein).
In Frankenstein repository, you will be pointed to the Qanary components, which are part of this analysis paper. You can directly find the components in [Qanary Components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components). All the components are recently updated to ensure reproducibility. 
One can educate them in detail about Qanary methodology and its usage on: [Qanary Methodology](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary). It also includes how to add a new component and run a pipeline. 

For non-expert users, a majority of components are available to access via a web UI: [Frankenstein Web UI](http://frankenstein.qanary-qa.com/).

# Component Performance

This folder contains all the files of the different question Answering Tasks (QA Tasks). F-score for each question per component
is given in the files.

# Component Performance Aggregated
This folder sums up the f-score values of the component per question feature for various QA tasks.

# Top Count
This folder contains values of the number of questions answered by Top 1, top 2...top n components together for each task.

# Unanswered
This folder contains all the unanswered questions, and the associated question features.
